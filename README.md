Scripts to stabilize nodes outside of apt-upgrades

I am creating this to help stabilizing a Multi Lokinet Service Node VPS (mSN). I am not very much interested in mSNs but have always had 2 small mSNs in order to learn about them and possibly contribute to making them less hated. Since the oxen price has been collapsing it is becoming sensible to look deeper into these. My mSNs have been very stable, but when they give problems they give hectic problems

This is an attempt at speeding up fixes when they happen.
